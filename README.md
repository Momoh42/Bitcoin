============

## Project Description
This project was conducted as part of the **Data Mining for Big Data** course in our Master's program in Computer Science, specializing in Machine Learning and Data Mining. The project is divided into two main tasks:

### 1. Bitcoin Price Prediction
Using historical Bitcoin data, we developed machine learning / time series models to predict the Bitcoin price based on the data from the first 6 days. The models used include:
- **(Robust) Linear Regression**
- **ARIMA** 
- **LSTM** 
- **Baseline**

### 2. Community Detection
The second part of the project focuses on analyzing interactions among Bitcoin market players over time using community detection techniques. The following algorithms were applied:
- **Louvain**
- **Greedy**
- **Label Propagation**

The goal was to understand the dynamic structure of the market and identify communities of actors with similar behaviors.
